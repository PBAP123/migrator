# Virtual Environment Directory (`venv/`) Context Primer

## Overview
The `venv/` directory contains a Python virtual environment that isolates the Migrator utility's Python dependencies from the system Python installation. This follows Python best practices for package management and deployment.

## Purpose
- Provides an isolated Python environment specific to Migrator
- Contains all required Python packages at specific versions
- Avoids conflicts with system-wide Python packages
- Ensures consistent execution environment
- Follows PEP 668 for isolation of Python dependencies

## Structure
This directory is automatically generated by Python's `venv` module and contains:
- A Python interpreter
- Standard library
- Pip package installer
- Installed packages in site-packages
- Activation scripts

## Relationship to Other Parts
- Created during installation by `migrator-init.sh`
- The virtual environment is activated by the wrapper script when running Migrator
- Contains the packages specified in requirements.txt
- Not meant to be edited manually or tracked in version control
- Can be safely deleted and recreated by the installer
